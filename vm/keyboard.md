You can arrange multiple layouts in any order you like.  


## Polytonic Greek keyboard ##


`vm2015` includes  a polytonic Greek keyboard (available with documentation [here](http://www.frame-poythress.org/keyboard-entry-of-polytonic-greek-and-biblical-hebrew-in-gnulinux-2014/)).  For a summary of key mappings, you can use [this chart](http://49ft7fdv9kp7kqhm12yk1d17.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2007KeyboardGreek.pdf).  Note that in this system, you type accents and breathings *before* the vowel they fall on.
