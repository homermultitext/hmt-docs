The HMT project VM for editors is a virtual machine including all the software necessary to edit and validate contributions to the Homer Multitext project.



The current VM (available from the `editors-vm` repository) has been used since the summer of 2015. It runs Ubuntu 14.04 with a LXDE GUI, and uses the `morpheus` parsing system to validate the morphology of Greek text.

A new version is currently being developed in the `summer2016` branch of the same repository, and will be the standard VM for the project beginning in the summer of 2016.    It runs [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) 0.3, and uses the `Kan≈çnes` system for parsing and validating the morphology of Greek text.

Documentation linked here is for the current release version (i.e., the summer 2015 standard).  For preliminary documentation of the development version, please [follow this link](vm2016).
