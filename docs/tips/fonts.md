- [The Greek Font Society](http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces18th.html). Beautiful, historically researched Greek typefaces, awesomely organized by century, openly licensed. You particularly want to check out Porson, which is what the Oxford Classical Texts use, and Gazis, which has a very nice "Textus Receptus of Robert Ã‰tienne" vibe.
- [Gentium](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=gentium). Bringing harmony to the world by making a free font with a very complete coverage of Unicode. 

## Writing

- ["Word Processors: Stupid and Inefficient"](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html). A classic essay on why you should use a text editor and something like Markdown.
- ["The Beauty of LaTeX"](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex). LaTex is what scientists and mathematicians use; it is capable of stunning typography like nothing you can get by any other means. It is crazy complicated, but these days you can do most of your work in Markdown and still get the benefits. Blackwell will be happy to have this conversation.
- [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net). An online editor. Write Markdown. Export to PDFs. Include crazy LaTeX stuff if you want.
